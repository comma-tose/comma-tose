## Hi, I'm Commatose!

You might also know me as Comma, or as Oko.
I am genderfluid and use any pronouns, but I prefer she/her.

As of right now, I know Python and Brainfuck.
I want to learn Z80 Assembly, C, C++, Lua, Java, and Kotlin, not in that order.
I also want to forget Python, since I hate it with every bit of my soul.

If you want to contact me, there are like 20,000 ways to do this.
You can view my pronouns.page at `https://en.pronouns.page/@Oko_`!
Talk to me on Discord at `@comma.tose`, or join my server at `https://discord.com/invite/QWCt426xHe`!
I also have Signal with the username `commatose.18` and Revolt with the username `comma.tose#0795`!
I have two Mastodon profiles, my main one being `commatose@tech.lgbt` and my second one being `genderfluidcomma@nekos.social`.
I have way too many email addresses. `genderfluidcomma@national.shitposting.agency` is my cock.li email, `commatose@is.notaskid.ong` forwards to my cock.li email, and `certifiedgenderfluid@furryfemboys.org` forwards to my primary Outlook email.

Alright you can stop reading now and go do something useful with your life!
